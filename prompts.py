    If the question is asking for code or asking the assistant personally, respond "False".
    If the assistant does not know the answer because the question needs real-time information, or the answer regularly with time and the assistant won't have the most up-to-date answer, or the question is about a fact that should be verified for accuracy online, respond "True".
    The question is {question}
    Do not provide an explanation. Your only responses should be "True" and "False" accordingly.
